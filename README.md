# Data Portfolio

## About Me
Hi! My name is Melanie Fitzgerald. I am a graduate student at Carroll University in Waukesha, WI pursuing an MBA with an emphasis in Business Analytics.

## Business Projects
Projects I worked on using the analytics skills I learned from the MBA program.

### Carroll University Master of Science in Physician Assistant Studies (MSPAS)

Chi-square analyses of application demographic trends in the PA Program. The data was obtained from the Graduate Admissions office from the national PA application database CASPA. The demographic data used for this project is state (where the applicant is from), age, and gender for the five most recent completed admissions cycles. The datatsets were cleaned in Excel and edited to only include the relevant demographic data. Analysis was done in SPSS which involved setting up the crosstables for each hypothesis statement. Comparisons of the relevant demographics include across admissions cycles, pre and post Covid pandemic changes in geographic diversity, and the demographics of matriculated students compared to the total application pool. *This was an MBA project.*

Data analysis of Likert scale evaluation data during the clinical year. This involved loading and cleaning data into Excel and using Tableau for visualizations to be used for analysis. *This was an MBA project.*

### Froedtert Workforce Health

Visualization using Tableau of Froedtert Workforce Health Clinics to show its locations and clinic information throughout southeast Wisconsin. Workforce Health is a division of Froedtert Health that contracts with businesses to provide an on-site health clinic for its employees. This involved loading data, cleaning data, and finding and adding geolocation coordinates of addresses before creating the visualization.

## MBA Projects

Analytics projects I completed for various courses in the MBA program.

### Excel
* A written report to describe vehical data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Used descriptive statistics to summarize vehical data. Conducted both a linear regession analysis and multilinear regression anaylsis to create models to predict vehicle fuel consumption. Evaluated the validity of the linear analysis to determine if it was the appropriate analysis for this data.
