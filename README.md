## About Me
Hi! My name is Melanie Fitzgerald. I am a graduate student at Carroll University in Waukesha, WI pursuing an MBA with an emphasis in Business Analytics.

## Business Projects

### Froedtert Workforce Health

Visualization using Tableau of Froedtert Workforce Health Clinics to show its locations and each clinic information throughout southeast Wisconsin. Workforce Health is a division of Froedtert Health that contracts with businesses to provide an on-site health clinic for its employees. This involved loading data, cleaning data, and finding and adding geolocation coordinates of addresses in Excel before creating the visualization.

## MBA Projects

Analytics projects I completed for various courses in the MBA program.

### Excel
* A written report to describe vehical data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Used descriptive statistics to summarize vehical data. Conducted both a linear regession analysis and multilinear regression anaylsis to create models to predict vehicle fuel consumption. Evaluated the validity of the linear analysis to determine if it was the appropriate analysis for this data.

### Python
* Data analysis to predict obesity rates using data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This involved loading the data, cleaning and preprocessing data, performing EDA, correlation analysis, and performing a multilinear regression analysis to create a model for prediction.
